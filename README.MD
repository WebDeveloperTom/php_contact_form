## Task: Contact Form Modal

"The client has requested that a contact form modal be added to their website. It must adhere to the following requirements:"
* Be built using PHP (suggest using Laravel and Bootstrap).
* Include the following fields: Name, Email, Phone, Message.
* Customer enquiries should be saved to a database.
* Customer enquiries should be emailed to the client.

## For next time
* If I was to do this again, next time I would add a Captcha to avoid spam being sent to a client.
* I would also look to make the site mobile responsive. This could easily be achieved through some CSS media queries.
* I would try to add some different colours to the Error/Success messages to make them stand out more.
* I could also add some highlighting to the different fields to indicate to the user which field they are on.
